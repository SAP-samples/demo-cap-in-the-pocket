# CAP in the Pocket

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/demo-cap-in-the-pocket)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/demo-cap-in-the-pocket)

Smartphones are more powerful then ever, with processors rivaling old laptops. So letâ€™s try to use them like a laptop to develop web-applications on the go. This repository is a demo to show you how to do use run and develop a [CAP Java](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/) Spring Boot application on your smartphone with [SapMachine](https://sapmachine.io) and how to run VSCode locally to develop and modify it. This, of course, works only on Android phones, as they are a Linux at their core.

This demo consists of a modified [cap-sflight](./cap-flight) sample application ([original](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight))
that can be built directly on device and a [VSCode plugin](./vscode-plugin/) to
simplify running the demo.

_This demo is a highly experimental prototype, used only for show-casing the ability of modern technology._

## Requirements

For this demo, you need an Android phone with the [Termux](https://termux.dev) app
installed.

The setup for this demo does neither require root on your smartphone, nor the use
of the developer mode.

## Setup

Launch the Termux app and set up an emulated Ubuntu environment:

```sh
pkg install proot-distro
proot-distro install ubuntu
proot-distro login ubuntu --termux-home
```

Clone this repository in the Ubuntu shell:

```sh
apt install git wget
git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/demo-cap-in-the-pocket
cd demo-cap-in-the-pocket
```

Install [SapMachine](https://sapmachine.io) and VSCode either by running
the [./install.sh] script or by running:

```sh
# Install SapMachine
wget -qO- https://dist.sapmachine.io/debian/sapmachine.key | tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/sapmachine.asc > /dev/null
echo "deb https://dist.sapmachine.io/debian/$(dpkg --print-architecture)/ ./" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sapmachine.list > /dev/null
apt update -y
apt install -y sapmachine-21-jdk

# Install VSCode
wget 'https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-arm64' -O code.deb
apt install -y ./code.deb
# Install the missing packages
apt -y --fix-broken install
rm code.deb

# Install the VSCode plugin
wget https://github.com/parttimenerd/cap-in-the-pocket-extension/releases/download/snapshot/cap-in-the-pocket-0.0.1.vsix .
code --install-extension cap-in-the-pocket-0.0.1.vsix --no-sandbox --user-data-dir ~
```

## Launch

Now you can now run VSCode at port 8080 either by running [./vscode.sh] script
or by running:

```sh
nohup code serve-web --port 8080 --without-connection-token --no-sandbox --user-data-dir ~ & 
```

And access it in the browser at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

Use the VSCode plugin to build and run the CAP SFlight application.
